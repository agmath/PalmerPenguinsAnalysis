## Palmer Penguins

Let's conduct an initial analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% head()
```

The `penguins` data set contains physiological measurements of different species of penguins observed on different islands and in different years. We can see the first six rows of the data set above.
